# Bismuth mod

<cr>**WARNING: This mod is still in the experimental stage and
very buggy! Alot of levels will not display correctly. This mod
should be percieved as something to experiment with rather than
something to use in actual gameplay.**</c>

A rendering optimization mod that serves to do alot of the level
processing and rendering on the GPU instead without affecting
gameplay.

I am currently not accepting bugfixes as there is already alot
of broken stuff to be fixed first.

2.2 levels currently don't work correctly.
